# Susuwatari Forever

## Description
This is a blogging website that makes popping the soot balls from the popular ghibli films it's main focus. When you create a post it will become a little soot ball that you can click on to pop and view the posts. In hindsight having you pop them does seem a bit cruel as in the films they are nothing but helpful. I just really wanted to make a website including them and was having trouble thinking of ways to have you interact through them. If I could redo this I would have them holding the post helpfully I think that would've been more appropiate. However it does serve its function.
